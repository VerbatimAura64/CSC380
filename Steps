Create Local repository
Create new file in said repository
git add <File Name> 
git commit -m "You need to type a message here" //This commits the file to the local repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/<Your Username>/<Repository Name>.git
git push -u origin master //master is the branch you are committing to, so replace that 
                          //with whichever branch you are commiting to
git pull //If you can't push a file(s), do this command first and your local repo will be up 
         //to date again allowing you to push
and then Voila
